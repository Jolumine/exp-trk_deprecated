## :hammer_and_wrench:Usage

The user interface is mostly self-explanatory but I'll give you a quick guide for the setup:

1. The setup will run automatically when you start the application. It will download the logos and create all necessary files, if you are connected to the internet. :arrow_heading_down::file_folder:
2. A window will be created and you have to set a admin username and a password for it.
3. Then the login will appear.
4. Click to create new user and fill in the requested information. :new:
5. After finishing the user creation, you can login and start using the application.:white_check_mark:
